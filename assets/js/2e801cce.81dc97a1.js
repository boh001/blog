Downgrade prettier to 2.x\\n2. force eslint-plugin-prettier to use 5.x using `overrides` field in package.json\\n\\nFirst one is easy to do, but i don\'t want to downgrade prettier even though there is compatible version.\\nSo i choose the second one.\\n\\n## What is overrides field in package.json?\\n\\n:::warning\\nIf you use yarn or npm, you have to use other fields like `resolutions`.\\nFor detail, please check documentation of each package manager.\\n:::\\n\\nDefinition of `overrides` field is below in pnpm.\\n\\nThis field allows you to instruct pnpm to override any dependency in the dependency graph.\\nThis is useful to enforce all your packages to use a single version of a dependency, backport a fix, or replace a dependency with a fork.\\n\\nLiterally, you can override any packages you want to use specific version.\\n\\n## Solution\\n\\nAdd `overrides` field in package.json like below.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"overrides\\": {\\n    \\"eslint-plugin-prettier\\": \\"5.0.1\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```"},{"id":"first-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/first-blog-post","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-23.md","title":"First Blog Post","description":"This is the first blog post on this site.","date":"2024-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 23, 2024","tags":[{"label":"blog","permalink":"/tags/blog"},{"label":"programming","permalink":"/tags/programming"},{"label":"korean","permalink":"/tags/korean"},{"label":"software engineer","permalink":"/tags/software-engineer"}],"readingTime":0.255,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sanghyeon Kim","title":"Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/boh001","imageURL":"https://github.com/boh001.png","key":"sanghyeon"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"first-blog-post","authors":"sanghyeon","title":"First Blog Post","description":"This is the first blog post on this site.","tags":["blog","programming","korean","software engineer"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to fix error \\"Prettier resolveConfig.sync is not a function\\"","permalink":"/how-to-fix-error-prettier-resolveConfig-sync"}},"content":"Hello, everyone!
