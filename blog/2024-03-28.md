![Prettier resolveConfig.sync is not a function](../static/img/eslint-prettier.jpeg)

## TL;DR

To Fix error "Prettier resolveConfig.sync is not a function", use `overrides` field in package.json

<!--truncate-->

## Intro

For each js project, i have been using my own eslint and prettier packages published at npm.
But when i started to use react-native, i got error "Prettier resolveConfig.sync is not a function".

development envrionment is below.

```
pnpm: 8.13.1
react-native: 0.73.2
prettier: 3.0.3
```

## What is a problem?

When you init your react-native project using `npx react-native init project`, you can see react-native use `eslint-plugin-prettier: ^4.2.1`.
But it's not compatible with `prettier: 3.0.3` that require `eslint-plugin-prettier` version 5 or later.

## How can i fix it?

There are two solutions we can choose.

1. Downgrade prettier to 1.x
2. force eslint-plugin-prettier to use 5.x using `overrides` field in package.json

First one is easy to do, but i don't want to downgrade prettier even though there is compatible version.
So i choose the second one.

## What is overrides field in package.json?

Definition of overrides field is below in pnpm.

This field allows you to instruct pnpm to override any dependency in the dependency graph.
This is useful to enforce all your packages to use a single version of a dependency, backport a fix, or replace a dependency with a fork.

Literally, you can override any packages you want to use specific version.

## Solution

Add `overrides` field in package.json like below.

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "eslint-plugin-prettier": "5.0.1"
  }
}
```

FYI, you have to use other fields like `resolutions` if you use yarn or npm.
For detail, please check documentation of each package manager.
